![Hotline Logo Banner](assets/hotline-logo-banner.jpg)

:wave: Hey, this is my first theme. I created it because I want a theme that has a dark grey background with bright font colors. I found so many great themes that were close but not there exactly so I decide to make my own. If you find it useful, great! 

It's still a work in progress and if you have any suggestions or see any issues please let me know.
